How to translate:


Our staff at GodsentFx will do the remaining job. For now, you should only make changes to the texts after the '-'

For example:

System â€¦.. English
A.b.o.ut - About
Add_image - Add image

Thr above was translated from system language to English. You should use the example to make translation from system to your language.

Please, do not remove the space. It will make the texts easier for us to understand.

If you don't know or not sure of the right word or translation, kindly skip that.

Always remember to hit the save button on your editor. Lol.

Get started now. Just remove the English and replace with the translation. Do not remove all the English words at once if it will make you confuse.


Sending love to you, from Africa!


System .......... English
